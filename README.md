# eop_surveys

This repository is for the Department of Family Medicine's End of Phase Survey project. The End of Phase (eop) survey is administered at the end of every spring semester to medical students. 
The eop survey consists of a validated instrument designed to assess professional identity. In addition to the professional identity instrument, the 3rd year students also submit clerkship evaluations. 
The aim of this project is to understand the relationship between, professional identity, clerkship evaluations, clerkship grades, and factors that influence students to pursue primary care and family medicine.
